    "The experiment setup is very similar to the positive sentiment notebook. However, in this notebook we fine-tune GPT2 (small) to generate **controlled** movie reviews based on the IMDB dataset. The model gets the target sentiment and 5 tokens from a real review and is tasked to produce continuations with the targeted sentiment. The reward for the continuations is calculated with the logits of a BERT sentiment classifier. That reward is then used for PPO training."
